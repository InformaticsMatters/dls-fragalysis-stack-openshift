# Runs fragalysis fragment processing to generate neo4j graph files.
# Here, the basic steps that take place are: -
#
# - clean-up (removal) of working directories
#   Separate directories are created for 'processing' (nextflow),
#   Grand 'de-duplication' and then an 'output' for graph files.
# - Download of a 'standard' file to the 'process' directory
# - Copy of the nextflow workflow to the 'process' directory
#
# Prior to any of this the 'configure' role is executed.
# This ensures that fragalysis is cloned and the required
# nextflow is installed.
#
# Before you start create a 'parameters' file (using 'parameters.template'
# as an example) and place your variable values in there and then run this
# role with the command: -
#
#   $ nohup ./run-graph-processor.sh &

- hosts: localhost

  roles:
  - graph-processor
