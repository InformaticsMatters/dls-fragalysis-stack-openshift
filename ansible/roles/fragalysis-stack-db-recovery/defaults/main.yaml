# DEV Recovery PVs and PVCs - used when recovery_deploy is 'yes'.
# Recovery of DEV MySQL backups to DEV, STAG or PROD.
#
# There is an entry here for each namespace that we want to recover to.
# The first one is our own namespace, others are for the namespaces
# of others, like staging and production. Each shares an NFS 'dir'
# (where the database backup exists) but has its own PV 'name',
# PVC 'claim' and 'namespace'
