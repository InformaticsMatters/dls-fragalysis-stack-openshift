# Test Data

## jun2018-plus-random-100.smiles
100 randomly selected (and shuffled) molecules from the jun2018-plus data set
(lines from the `nodes.csv` file annotated as `MOL` but without the
stereo-chemistry symbol `@`). Prepared in order to test
the performance of a neo4j graph database holding the whole set.

There are 27,460,242 such lines in the original `nodes.csv`.
